The techniques used for this project after Explanatory Data Analysis was performed were:  

<ul>
  <li>Model Building Strategies</li>
  <li>Box-Cox Test</li>
  <li>Clustering</li>
  <li>Decsion Trees</li>
</ul>


### Results 

The results of the project are as follows:  
<ul>

### Dataset 

The dataset was found from the online source Kaggle.  
The dataset that is being used in this project is the kc_house_data.csv.  
This dataset contains 23613 observations and includes 21 variables.  

### Installation and Execution 

The project contains two files that will need to be executed one of them being an RMD file and the other is a python file. To execute the RMD file, use the software R and R Studio. Import the data and the file itself to run the code in RStudio. To run the python file create a folder that contains both the dataset file and executable file in python or VS Code.
